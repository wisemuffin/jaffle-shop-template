# exclude_rules

# Rule definitions:
# L002: Mixed Tabs and Spaces in single whitespace
# L004: Incorrect indentation type (should be space)
# L004: Commas should not have whitespace directly before them.
# L010: Inconsistent capitalisation of keywords (should be lowercase)
# L011: Implicit/explicit aliasing of table (use 'as' for alias)
# L012: Implicit/explicit aliasing of columns (use 'as' for alias)
# L013: Column expression without alias (use 'as' for alias)
# L014: Inconsistent capitalisation of unquoted identifiers (should be lowercase)
# L016: Line is too long
# L018: WITH clause closing bracket should be on a new line.
# L019: Trailing comma enforcement
# L022: Blank line expected but not found after CTE closing bracket.
# L023: Single whitespace expected after AS in WITH clause.
# L027: References should be qualified if select has more than one referenced table/view
# L030: Inconsistent capitalisation of function names (should be lowercase)
# L031: Avoid table aliases in from clauses and join conditions
# L032: Prefer specifying join keys instead of using USING.
# L033: UNION [DISTINCT|ALL] is preferred over just UNION
# L034: Select wildcards then simple targets before calculations and aggregates
# L040: Inconsistent capitalisation of boolean/null literal (should be lowercase)
# L042: Join/From clauses should not contain subqueries. Use CTEs instead.
# L046: Jinja tags should have a single whitespace on either side.
# L048: Quoted literals should be surrounded by a single whitespace.
# L051: Join clauses should be fully qualified (LEFT/RIGHT/FULL/INNER)
# L054: Use numbers in GROUP BY and ORDER BY
# L065: Set operators should be surrounded by newlines.
